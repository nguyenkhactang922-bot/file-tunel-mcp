## Current complete-upgrade pointer

- FMG-020: DONE / MAIN VERIFIED at 4f99a60ba91abc0040364f70c9df86478fc4dab2 (Verify 36675201004 SUCCESS).
- FMG-021: ACTIVE on chatgpt/FMG-021-workspace-checkpoint.
- NEXT_EXACT_ACTION: FMG-021 exact-head 3aa0f59 Verify 36695888973: ARM64 full PASS; x64 failed later in unchanged Job Object assignment with Access denied; macOS static PASS but Integration test compile failed on try-inside-precondition. Swift harness is locally remediated with contract guard PASS. Commit/push test-only fix and require fresh exact-head Verify; do not weaken ProcessRunner unless x64 reproduces. FMG-022 remains blocked.
